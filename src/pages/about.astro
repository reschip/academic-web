        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I am a dedicated and innovative Computer Science professional from Veracruz, Mexico, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at CINVESTAV. With a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision, I have cultivated both academic and professional expertise to tackle challenging problems in AI.</p>
            
            <p>I have over a year of experience as an AI Analyst at Layer7MX, where I applied and expanded my skills in MLOps, Docker, MLflow, Weights & Biases, Scikit-Learn, and classic data analysis, visualization, and model training. I also explored cutting-edge technologies in Large Language Models (LLMs), AI agents, OpenAI, Gemini, and LangGraph, along with state-of-the-art research in speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) in Spanish. My professional journey is complemented by research internships at CIMAT and BUAP, where I strengthened my analytical, problem-solving, and algorithmic development skills.</p>
            
            <p>I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and Java, fluent in Spanish, and have an intermediate level of English, enabling me to collaborate effectively in international teams. I thrive in environments where teamwork, leadership, and continuous learning intersect, and I am always motivated to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of AI and technology.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I nurture creativity, strategy, and collaboration through my personal interests. I enjoy management and simulation games like Cities: Skylines, Minecraft, and other online multiplayer games, which challenge my planning, teamwork, and problem-solving skills in fun and dynamic ways. I also enjoy the thrill of survival horror games and immersing myself in suspense and horror films. Music is another outlet for my creativity; I play both guitar and piano, which helps me explore rhythm, harmony, and expression in a different medium.</p>
            
            <p>I aim to merge technical expertise with creativity, research, and innovation, contributing to meaningful advancements in AI while collaborating with like-minded professionals passionate about shaping the future of intelligent systems.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, my Master's studies at CINVESTAV allow me to deepen my research and technical expertise, pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in AI and preparing me to contribute to cutting-edge innovations in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. My academic journey continues to shape me into a well-rounded, forward-thinking professional ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.</p>
